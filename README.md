## Future update
- Refactor the getter and setter functions to Python properties.
- Change the `show` function to an `__str__` magic method, so that we can use `print` on objects instead of calling `show()`.
- Add an option to use `>` and `<` to compare product prices.
- Add an option to check if a product exists in store using the `in` operator.
- Add an option to combine two stores using the `+` operator. This will create a new instance of `Store` with products from both stores.
- Support multiple promotions for a single item.
